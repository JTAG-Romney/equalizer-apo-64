# EqualizerAPO - 64bit port

This repo contains a 64-bit port of [EqualizerAPO](https://sourceforge.net/p/equalizerapo/) - system wide equalizer for Windows.
Standard Equalizer APO performs all sound processing using 32-bit float number. This is a modification of the processing engine 
that uses 64-bit double precision numbers instead. This increases fidelity especially with complex configuration files (like configurations 
generated by [HeSuVi](/https://sourceforge.net/projects/hesuvi/)).

No functionality was added or modified. The source code is based on commit *r73* of the original repo.

## Installation

1. Install standard version of EqualizerAPO. Do not perform configuration yet.
2. Save a copy of the original EqualizerAPO.dll file in case you'd like to restore original installation.
3. Unpack the archive from the files section into the Equalizer APO installation folder. This will replace the EqualizerAPO.dll file.
4. Run the Configuration tool as usual. After reboot EqualizerAPO will use 64-bit processing engine.
